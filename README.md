I decided to continue my input validation in the OfferCommand class.

My intention is to not allow you to send more than one offer to the same person, or rather, 
that you can only HAVE one offer per persona active at any time. If you offer something to someone, and then go to offer again before they have accepted it won't let you. 
This prevents you from overwriting a previous offer and losing items, while also not requiring me to create a system where you can create multiple offers to someone. 
It would require either unique ID's, or naming them and for now as I am still learning I am keeping it simple. 
Keeping it simple, I say, while this method involves a lot more complex work than I was prepared for. 
I have no clue if what I have worked on thus far to incorporate this will work or not, I am grasping at straws and I will struggle to test this myself.

I imagine I will have a LOT of branches moving forward, and I have no idea how my project is going to change from this point on.

Backup created while trying to push to git branch, it uploaded my 1.0 work and not the 1.1 work.
